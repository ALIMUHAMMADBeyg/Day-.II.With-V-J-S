//primitive data types and reference data types


//Primitive data types and Non primitive Data Types

//primitive data types 
//stored directly in the location the variable access
//stored on the stack


//Reference data types
//Acccessed by reference
//objects that are stored on the heap
//A pointer to a location in the memory
//Primitive data types are stored in memory as a single value,
// while reference data 
//types are stored as a reference or pointer to the location in memory where the value is stored.

//In javascript there are six primitive data types
//Number
//string
//boolean
//Null
//Undefined
//symbols(Es6)

//reference types
//they are accessed by reference
//Arrays 
//Object Literals
//Functions
//Dates
//Anything Else


//Dynamically Typed Language
//Types are associated with values not variable
//the same variable can hold multiple types
//we donot need specific types
//there are super jets and addons to allow  static typing (Typescript,flow);

//the same variable can hold multiple types 

//primitive 
//string
const name = 'jon doe';
//age 
const age = '45';
//boolean
const haskidz = true;
//Null
const fool = resons;
//undefined
let test;
//symbol 
const sym = symbol;
console.log(typeof sym);
//let it else then
